[00:02.75] We're at a crossroad
[00:05.88] And we don't know which way to go
[00:09.17] Part of me lost hope
[00:13.06] And part of me just can't let go
[00:29.06] 
[00:15.57] We said we'd cross those bridges when they came
[00:19.27] Now it's time they get a name
[00:22.22] Yeah, we're at a crossroad
[00:25.81] So, baby, let me know
[00:36.31] 
[00:28.55] Do I call you my ex or do I call you my boyfriend?
[00:32.14] Call you a lover, do I call you a friend?
[00:35.28] Call you the one or the one that got away?
[00:39.05] Someone I'll just have to forget
[00:55.05] 
[00:42.19] Do I call you every night you're gone
[00:45.72] Or never call you again?
[00:49.98] Do we have a future
[00:53.23] Or should I call it the end?
[01:07.23] 
[00:57.18] We were a moment
[01:00.25] And you were my only true oasis
[01:03.43] Now all those oceans
[01:06.87] Are falling down our faces
[01:19.87] 
[01:10.07] So if we don't see it through
[01:13.35] I'm a better me because of you
[01:16.36] Yeah, we're at a crossroad
[01:20.07] So, baby, let me know
[01:30.57] 
[01:22.95] Do I call you my ex or do I call you my boyfriend?
[01:26.56] Call you a lover, do I call you a friend?
[01:29.42] Call you the one or the one that got away?
[01:33.49] Someone I'll just have to forget
[01:49.49] 
[01:36.43] Do I call you every night you're gone
[01:39.85] Or never call you again?
[01:44.54] Do we have a future
[01:47.18] Or should I call it the end? (Ooh)
[02:04.18] 
[01:53.53] Should I call it the end? (Ooh)
[02:00.32] Are we lovers or friends? (Ooh)
[02:07.04] Is this as good as it gets?
[02:13.60] Should I call it the end?
